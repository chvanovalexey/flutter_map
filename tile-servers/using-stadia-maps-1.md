# Using Stadia Maps

{% hint style="info" %}
'flutter\_map' is in no way associated or related with Stadia Maps.

To display their map tiles, Stadia Maps usually provides a 'Static Maps Base URL' for map styles. However, to integrate with 3rd-party APIs, they also provide a 'Raster XYZ PNGs URL' , and tiles requested through this endpoint consume 'Styled Raster Map Tiles' credits. This URL needs no extra configuration to integrate with flutter\_map.

Retina tiles (high-DPI) tiles are available. Use the URLs containing '@2x' instead of '{r}'. The maximum zoom level that Stadia Maps supports is 20, so it is recommended to set `maxNativeZoom` or `maxZoom` as such.

Attribution is required, see [docs.stadiamaps.com/#legal-details-required-attribution](https://docs.stadiamaps.com/#legal-details-required-attribution).

Consider using the [#richattributionwidget](../layers/attribution-layer.md#richattributionwidget "mention") or [#simpleattributionwidget](../layers/attribution-layer.md#simpleattributionwidget "mention")s, which meet the requirements.

## Styles

Stadia Maps offers a variety of ready-made map styles that don't require customization. URLs are found with the style: see the available [map styles](https://docs.stadiamaps.com/themes). The URL should be used as above.

## Vector Usage

Stadia Maps' also provides vector tiles. For more information about using vector tiles, please see [#using-vector-tiles](../why-and-how/how-does-it-work/raster-vs-vector-tiles.md#using-vector-tiles "mention").&#x20;

However, please note that this method of integration is still experimental. Many of the Stadia Maps styles utilize advanced features of the Mapbox GL JSON style language which are not yet well-supported.
